										<h2>Fin Flutter Research Project</h2>
										<p>Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI)</p>
									</header>
									<p class="justified"><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>The FURI funded project, officially titled "Fin Flutter Study: The Effects of Fin Geometry and Motor Design on a Sounding Rocket", is a project I created with the help of my mentors Professor Daniel White and Master's Student Lauren Brunacini. It began with the intent of building a sounding rocket equipped with electronics capable of measuring the flutter in fins. The goal was to study what fin profiles reduced the effect of flutter the most. While analyzing costs of the project, it was found that the cost of purchasing enough motors to gain sufficient data far exceed the alloted funding given by FURI. So, instead of cancelling or changing the project, myself and ther other leaders of my club Daedalus Astronautics saw an opportunity. Our Solid Propellant team was in the process of deciding on a project for the 2016-2017 school year to focus on, and I put forward the idea of the team working towards the development of flight capable motors.</p>

										<h2>Tripoli Certification Launches</h2>
										<p>Personal</p>
									</header>
									<p  class="justified"><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Tripoli Overview: Tripoli Rocketry Association, Inc. is an organization that exists to help amateur rocketry enthusiasts build and lunch in a safe and legal manner. The Tripoli Phoenix group (link site) puts on launches once a month North West of Metropolitan Phoenix. Tripoli gives out certifications to members which qualifies them to launch certain sized motors and eventually experimental motors. Motors are typically classified by their impulse ranges, with each range having a character of the alphabet assigned to it. A children’s Estes rocket can range from size A to C, a Tripoli Level 1 attempt rocket is typically an H or I motor, and the Space Shuttle main engine is size AG. L1 attempt 1: When I was a freshman at ASU and had spent a semester in Daedalus Astronautics, I wanted to attempt to get my Tripoli Level 1 flight certification. Many people on their first rocket typically use what is called a single deploy method, where a black powder charge is placed at the top of the motor, and when the motor finishes burning, the black powder ignites. That pressure build-up pushes the nosecone out of the rocket’s body tube which also pulls out a parachute, then the rocket glides safely to the ground. This method is reliable and pretty simple, however I wanted to do something more on my L1 attempt. I decided to use a dual deploy rocket, which is something much more commonly used on advanced high-power rocket. Dual deploy refers to when a rocket has two parachutes, a drogue and main, which are deployed by electronics containing either a barometric sensor or an accelerometer. I used the book “Modern High Power Rocketry 2” (link and author name) as well as older members of my club’s advice. The first step of the project was to design it in a software called RockSim 9. RockSim is a simulation and design software that helps a person figure out if their rocket is flight capable and achieves the desired results before they invest the time and money required to build a rocket. I designed the rocket based on body tubes and materials that my club already had available in our surplus section. I decided to use an Aerotech I600 motor. The body tube was phenolic and I wrapped it in fiberglass and coated the fiberglass in epoxy to reinforce the phenolic structurally. </p>

										<h2>Drag race team lead</h2>
										<p>Daedalus Astronautics</p>
									</header>
									<p class="justified"><span class="image left"><img src="images/drag team.jpg" alt="" /></span>Daedalus Astronautics has a program where freshman who have just joined the club are put on a "drag team." The program involves two teams of freshman competing against one another to develop a high powered rocket. The parameters are that the team must use an identical motor, body tube diameter, and nose cone. Each team launches, and the team whose electronics indicate they reached an altitude of 3,000ft first wins. The program is designed to get freshman excited about rocketry and to teach them relevant concepts. I led a group of 4 freshman (2 were unable to attend the launch pictured) and helped them develop the rocket. This was my first experience managing an engineering project. I did barely any of the actual work by hand, as the program is intened for freshman to build their own rocket, so I had to learn how to effectively communicate and teach the students what they needed to know. Each week I taught a lesson on fundamental concepts of rocketry and rocket design. I led builds and taught the team how to use tools and equipment necessary for building. I organized a tour of the ASU machine shop and ASU 3D printing lab. I taught the members how to use SolidWorks, and they designed centering rings to 3D print as well as an electronics bay to laser cut. The project was a lot of fun, and even though we lost by 0.4 seconds, the team learned a lot and so did I.</p>

										<h2>Hybrid Rocket Engine Rebuild</h2>
										<p>Daedalus Astronautics</p>
									</header>
									<p class="justified"><span class="image left"><img src="images/hre.png" alt="" /></span>During my first year in Daedalus Astronautics, I expressed a lot of interest in solid modelling and machining. The president at the time decided that I would be the right person to rebuild the small-scale hybrid rocket test engine that the club had. The one they had at the time had been fired over 50 times and needed to be retired. So, I was assigned to rebuild the test engine. I spent many hours teaching myself how to use SolidWorks on YouTube,<span class="image right"><img src="images/lathe.jpg" alt="" /></span> learning how O-rings and their corresponding grooves work, and learning from ASU's machine shop how to use a mill and lathe. It took me about 6 months to complete the project, but by the end I was extremely comfortable using almost all machining exquipment. I was able to learn G-code, a bit of welding, and using bandsaws. We tested the whole system at the end of the semester and everything I built worked! The video of the first test fire can be seen about 20 seconds into the video I have playing on the home page. Note: If you're reading this far, I assume you can see in the video that it is a pretty ugly burn. That was the only video I was able to get, and we were having issues with our ozidizer flow, so I'm sorry!</p>

I first used Squarespace, but then was told by a <a href="http://www.brettbauman.xyz">friend</a> about <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a></li>, which offers free HTML5 templates. It was not only a much cheaper option, but an opportunity for me to learn how to code in HTML and CSS. It has been a very educational experience and I love the site. </p>
